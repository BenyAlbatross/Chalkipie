A digital door chalk archive that allows students in NUS to upload and preserve their door chalks, giving them something tangible to remember their time living in dorm. Alongside simple archival, the project introduces whimsical AI-powered features that can “beautify,” “uglify,” or “sloppify” each door chalk, as well as generate a custom doorbell inspired by the door itself.
